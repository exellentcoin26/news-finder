# Similarity Checker

Group a large set of articles based on their topic.

## Possible Algorithms

- Cosine similarity - requires checking all articles against all others (Implemented for now)
- DBSCAN - requires fiddling with and testing parameters
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation - No fiddling or supervising of parameters, only massaging of the dataset
